# test-canvas-usercourses
A little test program for a specific canvas api we use.

We seem to have a problem that some course rooms are sometimes missing
from a response.
This tests shows that sometimes some rooms are duplicated, but the
total number of rooms included the duplicates stays the same, so when
some rooms are duplicated, others are missing.
